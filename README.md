# Pattern_Recognition_Project
Project for the pattern recognition course

This project contains several python files. Most of them are to get the restuls found in the paper, except for the Pix2Pix and the Sqeezenet files. We tried to implement those frameworks, but were not able to make them work for us. Still, we left them in the repository for potential later purposes. 

DataLoad: allows to import the dataset files. 

CNN: contain the CNN model used in the paper

DataAugmentation: contains the training of the CNN, using traditional data augmentation methods 

CNN + DCGAN: contains the DCGAN implementation and training

DCGAN: is not used anymore right? 

Test.csv + Train.csv: ?? is this used, I did not use it?
